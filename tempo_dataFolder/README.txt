ECE 160 Spring 2020
Mini Project 2
*******************

This is an example data folder, with a subset of files from the ismir2004 dataset. The name of the folder should be a variable in one of the initial blocks of your code.

The folder will contain 2 files per audio track. One is the track itself (a .wav file, specified as 'fileName.wav'), and the other is a file containing the human estimated tempo value in an ASCII format (a .bpm file, specified as 'fileName [space] beat.bpm')

If you decide to test with this folder, we strongly recommend supplementing these files with more examples from the dataset. You do not need to provide your final dataset when you submit your notebook, we will simply read though your results and test your code with a test dataset of our own while grading.
